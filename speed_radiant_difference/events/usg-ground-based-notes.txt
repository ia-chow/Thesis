LCs for all events are in May 2022 format, EXCEPT FOR:

- Almahatta Sitta
- Buzzard Coulee
- Kalabity
- Kosice

which are in the no-image format




notes after March 15 meeting:

plot speed and radiant difference vs. entry angle  
    colour-coded by duration, peak intensity, total energy (integrated intensity), height of peak brightness
    8 plots total


get luminous length, begin height, end height, duration/length above -12 and above -17 for all events
    references from B&B paper
    add to existing events csv files



Almahatta Sitta:

begin and end heights in fireball sheet corroborated by reference
no length from either

Buzzard Coulee:

begin, end heights and length in fireball sheet
begin and end heights in reference match sheet, length not provided in reference

Chelyabinsk:

begin, end heights and length in fireball sheet

Kosice:

begin height in reference is different than fireball sheet (using reference here)
end heights match
no length

Motopi Pan:

length provided by fireball sheet, not given in reference
begin height in reference is different than fireball sheet (using reference here)
end height not provided in fireball sheet but given in reference

Crawford Bay:

no info provided in fireball sheet
length provided in reference
begin, end height estimates provided in reference

Baird Bay:

no info provided in fireball sheet
length not in reference
begin height in reference
end height not estimated in reference due to technical limitations; use large explosion height as end height

Kalabity:

no info provided in fireball sheet
length not in reference
begin height in reference
end height in reference

Romania:

no info provided in fireball sheet
begin, end height provided in reference
length not explicitly provided but inferred from Fig. 8 (~66? km)

Flensburg:

begin and end height but not length provided in fireball sheet
begin height, end height, length all provided in reference; begin and end heights agree between fireball sheet and reference

Novo Mesto:

begin and end height but not length provided in both fireball sheet and reference
slight disagreement on begin and end height (using reference here)

Saricicek:

length, begin height, end height all provided in fireball sheet
begin and end heights in the reference agree with fireball sheet, length not in reference

Vinales:

no data in either sheet or reference
    maybe some data in one of the other papers mentioned in ceballos-izquierda 2021 but they are all in spanish

Froslunda:

begin, end height provided in reference but not fireball sheet
length not provided (or maybe it is but I can't read norwegian)

2022 EB5:

NASA JPL website (reference) doesn't have begin/end heights or length...
neither does sheet

2019 MO:

NASA JPL website (reference) doesn't have begin/end heights or length...
neither does sheet

Ozerski:

no data in either sheet or reference
