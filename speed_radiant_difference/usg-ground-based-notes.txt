LCs for all events are in May 2022 format, EXCEPT FOR:

- Almahatta Sitta
- Buzzard Coulee
- Kalabity
- Kosice

which are in the no-image format


notes after March 15 meeting:

plot speed and radiant difference vs. entry angle  
    colour-coded by duration, peak intensity, total energy (integrated intensity), height of peak brightness
    8 plots total


get luminous length, begin height, end height, duration/length above -12 and above -17 for all events
    references from B&B paper
    add to existing events csv files

end height in reference
length imputed from existing data

Romania:

no info provided in fireball sheet

length not explicitly provided but inferred from Fig. 8 (~66? km)
length imputed from existing data

Flensburg:

begin and end height but not length provided in fireball sheet
begin height, end height, length all provided in reference; begin and end heights agree between fireball sheet and reference

Novo Mesto:

begin and end height but not length provided in both fireball sheet and reference
slight disagreement on begin and end height (using reference here)
length imputed from existing data

Saricicek:

length, begin height, end height all provided in fireball sheet
begin and end heights in the reference agree with fireball sheet, length not in reference

Vinales:

no data in sheet
begin, end height provided in reference, length not in reference
length imputed from existing data

Froslunda:

begin, end height provided in reference but not fireball sheet
length not provided (or maybe it is but I can't read norwegian)
length imputed from existing data

2022 EB5:

NASA JPL website (reference) doesn't have begin/end heights or length...
neither does sheet

no data

2019 MO:

NASA JPL website (reference) doesn't have begin/end heights or length...
neither does sheet

Use 62.2 degrees zenith angle, 16.45 km/s speed, 25 km height of peak brightness (from ground-based data)
GLM light curve has total estimated duration ~0 seconds-2.390 seconds (from 21:25:47.300 UTC - 21:25:49.597 UTC) and peak brightness occurs at ~1.64 seconds (at 21:25:48.939 UTC)
	Determine length of trail using light curve duration and seed (assuming constant speed)
	Determine begin and end heights using length of trail, zenith angle, and peak brightness height and time

begin height seems quite low...

Ozerski:

no data in either sheet or reference

Use 12.4 degrees zenith angle, 14.9 km/s speed, 27.2 km height of peak brightness (from paper)
Light curve has total duration from ~0 seconds-4.4 seconds and the peak brightness occurs at ~3.5 seconds
	Determine length of trail using light curve duration and speed (assuming constant speed)
	Determine begin and end heights using length of trail, zenith angle, and peak brightness height and time


Recomputing radiants for several events assuming sign typos in CNEOS data (as in https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac75d2/pdf for TC3/AS) to see if usg, ground-based match up better afterwards:

2008 TC3/Almahatta Sitta (2008-10-07 02:45:45 UT):

flipping [-9, 9, 3.8] km/s to [-9, 9, -3.8] km/s gives a radiant azimuth/zenith angle that produces radiant diff that almost exactly matches the ground-based observations, as noted

Buzzard Coulee (2008-11-21 00:26:44 UT):

flipping [3.9, -4.1, -11.6] km/s to [3.9, 4.1, -11.6] km/s gives a radiant azimuth/zenith angle within 11 degrees of ground-based... probably not enough?
aside from that nothing...

Kosice (2010-02-28 22:24:50 UT):

nothing...

Crawford Bay (2017-09-05 05:11:27 UT):

nothing...

Saricicek (2015-09-02 20:10:30 UT) (typo in the date in B&B):

nothing...

Re-generated all the speed/radiant diff vs. various parameters plots with the recomputed radiant difference for AS, no obviously noticeable change in the trend...



TODO:

Plot cdfs/histograms of radiant/speed difference across their domain (should see bimodality of radiant diff), take 50% as difference between "low" and "high" radiant diff events?
Try looking at other dimensionality reduction methods (maybe look at the old t-SNE/UMAP or VAE code from UG work)
