2022 EB5:

NASA JPL website (reference) doesn't have begin/end heights or length...
neither does sheet

no data

2019 MO:

NASA JPL website (reference) doesn't have begin/end heights or length...
neither does sheet

Use 62.2 degrees zenith angle, 16.45 km/s speed, 25 km height of peak brightness (from ground-based data)
GLM light curve has total estimated duration ~0 seconds-2.390 seconds (from 21:25:47.300 UTC - 21:25:49.597 UTC) and peak brightness occurs at ~1.64 seconds (at 21:25:48.939 UTC)
	Determine length of trail using light curve duration and seed (assuming constant speed)
	Determine begin and end heights using length of trail, zenith angle, and peak brightness height and time

begin height seems quite low...

Ozerski:

no data in either sheet or reference

Use 12.4 degrees zenith angle, 14.9 km/s speed, 27.2 km height of peak brightness (from paper)
Light curve has total duration from ~0 seconds-4.4 seconds and the peak brightness occurs at ~3.5 seconds
	Determine length of trail using light curve duration and speed (assuming constant speed)
	Determine begin and end heights using length of trail, zenith angle, and peak brightness height and time


Recomputing radiants for several events assuming sign typos in CNEOS data (as in https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac75d2/pdf for TC3/AS) to see if usg, ground-based match up better afterwards:

2008 TC3/Almahatta Sitta (2008-10-07 02:45:45 UT):

flipping [-9, 9, 3.8] km/s to [-9, 9, -3.8] km/s gives a radiant azimuth/zenith angle that produces radiant diff that almost exactly matches the ground-based observations, as noted

Buzzard Coulee (2008-11-21 00:26:44 UT):

flipping [3.9, -4.1, -11.6] km/s to [3.9, 4.1, -11.6] km/s gives a radiant azimuth/zenith angle within 11 degrees of ground-based... probably not enough?
aside from that nothing...

Kosice (2010-02-28 22:24:50 UT):

nothing...

Crawford Bay (2017-09-05 05:11:27 UT):

nothing...

Saricicek (2015-09-02 20:10:30 UT) (typo in the date in B&B):

nothing...

Re-generated all the speed/radiant diff vs. various parameters plots with the recomputed radiant difference for AS, no obviously noticeable change in the trend...


Added Queensland event (done, although I can't use it in the analysis yet because it doesn't have a LC) 
Created speed/radiant diff vs. date plots
Plotted CDFs/histograms of radiant/speed difference across domain


Dimensionality reduction (preliminary done):

10 parameters used in pca and umap: speed, height of max brightness, date, begin height, end height, length, peak intensity, duration, total energy, entry angle
16 data points: everything except qld (no LC) and eb5 (no length or begin/end height)
    could redo the pca and umap/tsne removing some of these parameters so we could use qld or eb5?

PCA doesn't show anything obvious...
UMAP identifiies (tentatively) one unique group of 3 (Kalabity, Baird Bay, Froslunda) but could just be luck...


Monte Carlo Granvik Model:

Draw smooth KDE to sample from using nonparametric distribution with a Gaussian kernel
Read in decameter events
Estimated speed uncertainty for 100 Monte Carlo samples for each decameter event by drawing from the KDE
    Ran the state vectors for all the Monte Carlo samples for each event through the WMPL code to convert the state vectors to orbital parameters, and then saved the orbital parameters to a .npy file
    Checked SMA of MC samples againt the true values to see if it was working as expected
        checks out!


Granvik model probabilistic association of events with escape regions notes:

2. WMPL sometimes doesn't return the orbital parameters when certain state vectors are input
    - Could talk to Denis about this
4. Granvik model only has discrete samples of the 4-D distribution in a multidimensional grid, so interpolating the distribution for the whole parameter space
    - 3 different methods; RBF with linear, cubic spline over a rectilinear grid (tensor product of several 1-D interpolations), nearest-neighbour
    - Tensor product of 1-D cubic spline interpolations over a rectilinear grid is the method I think I want to do...
5. Granvik gmb_model.dat and gmb_model-noheader files have a typo; there is a single value of Hmag = 15.605 instead of what I believe should be 15.625
    - Also remember that Granvik model file needs to be gotten from the dropbox if I want to use locally


Friday, April 12 meeting:

- Add the info for 1994 Marshall Islands and other events (check the Mendeley 10m-project folders to see those...) to the master decameter impactors excel sheet and run everything through the pipeline again to generate the same ER probability/sigma plots for those events as well DONE! (check that the values are right with peter...)
	- 1994 looks pretty noisy and not sure as wmpl doesn't match up with orbital parameters given in the paper... ask peter about this
    - 1999 (Recent Satellite Observations of Large Meteor Events by Pack et al. 1999) looks ok
        histogram results are a bit noisy but not as much as the others?
    - 1988
    - 2004 (Satellite Observations of the 3 September, 2004 Antarctic Bolide -- Preliminary Results by Pack et al. 2004 report)
        No paper to compare to but looks ok... speed seems a bit low though?
        Diameter not given so have 10 as a placeholder for now...
        histogram results look really good!
    - 2001
    - 2002
    - 2000

- Get the CSV of telescopic asteroids with condition code <= 5 asteroids from NASA's website (a few hundred objects) and then run all the AEI (with H equal to the max H in the granvik model) values through the granvik interpolator; then plot the probability distributions of all of those points and compare that to the distributions we see for the decameter impactor events DONE!
	mostly in line with our decameter impactors; mostly inner main belt, nu6 probabilities between ~0.6-0.8 with some ~0.2 or so from hungaria and 3/1 each

- Read through the Granvik (2018) paper to understand what all the ERs are and what it physically measn to come from nu6, hungaria etc. DONE!


K-S test stuff -- DONE BUT CHECK THIS WITH OTHERS TO MAKE SURE IT'S IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY

check with max/althea
	check using althea's r package?

The 1 and 2-sample 3-D K-S tests for the aei distributions of impactors vs. telescopic objects using the Peacock 1983 and Fasano & Franceschini 1987 methodology suggest that the p-value is very low (~5e-3 for 1-sample, ~4e-7 for 2-sample) in both cases
	1-sample case is done by drawing a 3-D KDE over the telescopic distribution and comparing the impactors to that
	2-sample case is done by directly comparing the telescopic and impactor distribution
		both cases suggest impactors are statistically distinct -- not drawn from the same aei distribution as the telescopically observed population
		small sample size for impactors (only ~15 or so) could affect this though, especially individual weirdness like for bering sea...


TODO:

- Read Trilling et al. 2017, DeMeo et al. 2022, Nesvorny et al. 2023 (NEOMOD papers)
- Potential typo in 1999 event (44.0 latitude vs. 44.8)... check with paper...
