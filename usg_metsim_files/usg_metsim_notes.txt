rho_grain = 3500
Lambda * gamma = 0.8 (set A = 0.8)

bins could be like, 2 or something




notes:

radiant azimuth in the clark paper and in the jpl file sent (13 degrees) doesn't match with the one given in usg_input.txt (19 degrees) for the 09/18/2020 fireball? 
zenith angle also doesn't quite match (~66.96 in the jpl file, 66.87 in the usg_input.txt file)

some of the light curves extend below 0 km?? (e.g. oct 2009, jul 2010)


Sep 2020: finished for now w/ peter's help 

Feburary 2016: using 1.05e6 mass and something like 3500-4000 grain density, 
almost matched everything except the final bit (doesn't seem like I can squeeze enough mass out of it at the end unfortunately)

December 2020: using 5e5 mass
doesn't seem like there's enough mass here?? to get a consistently high light curve throughout -- ask about this during the meeting...
can't match the last bit again, same issue with not being able to squeeze enough mass out of it at the end

April 2013: using 3e6 mass, 4000 grain density, 0.0005 global ablation coefficient
matches pretty well other than the light curve being a little too high at the end but that's it

December 2010: using 6e6 mass, 3000 grain density, 1000 bulk density, 0.01 global ablation coefficient
matches very well throughout, probably the best one




light curves: below ~-17 magnitude or so is the noise threshold
global ablation should be 0.005 (5e-3), grain density 3500 bulk density 1500, none of these should be changed
 







finished creating/inputting all the usg files other than the ones noted below:

september 03 2004 event: doesn't have velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in the jpl file or on cneos website

currently incomplete

June 02/06 2002 event: provided bolide light curve say June 06, CNEOS website and JPL spreadsheet say June 02 (??)
also doesn'ty have altitude, velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in the jpl file or on cneos website

April 23 2001 event: also doesn't have velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in either source

February 18 2000 event: doesn't have altitude, velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in either source

January 14 1999 event: doesn't have velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in either source
