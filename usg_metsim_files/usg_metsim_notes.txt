METSIM PARAMETERS:

rho_bulk = 1500
rho_grain = 3500
Lambda * gamma = 0.8 (set A = 0.8)

Borovicka et al 2020

bins could be like, 2 or something

light curves: below ~-17 magnitude or so is the noise threshold
global ablation should be 0.005 (5e-3), grain density 3500 bulk density 1500, none of these should be changed
 




notes:

radiant azimuth in the clark paper and in the jpl file sent (13 degrees) doesn't match with the one given in usg_input.txt (19 degrees) for the 09/18/2020 fireball? 
zenith angle also doesn't quite match (~66.96 in the jpl file, 66.87 in the usg_input.txt file)

some of the light curves extend below 0 km?? (e.g. oct 2009, jul 2010)



finished creating/inputting all the usg files other than the ones noted below:

september 03 2004 event: doesn't have velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in the jpl file or on cneos website

currently incomplete

June 02/06 2002 event: provided bolide light curve say June 06, CNEOS website and JPL spreadsheet say June 02 (??)
also doesn'ty have altitude, velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in the jpl file or on cneos website

April 23 2001 event: also doesn't have velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in either source

February 18 2000 event: doesn't have altitude, velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in either source

January 14 1999 event: doesn't have velocity, entry angle or azimuth data either in either source






August 2:

Feb 1994, Dec 2018 are the two events where the data was manually obtained from digitizing
Feb 2013 data is not USG (manually constructed Chelyabinsk LC)

The feb 1994, dec 2018 lcs are not aligned so the maximum brightness is at time 0


EXAMPLE Sep 2020: finished for now w/ peter's help


Individual LC MetSim fit notes:

December 2010: using 6e6 mass, 3000 grain density, 1000 bulk density, 0.01 global ablation coefficient, everything else default
matches very well throughout, probably the best one

February 2013: 1.5e7 mass, default grain/bulk density and ablation coefficient -- can't get enough mass to fill out the peak part -- ask peter!

April 2013: using 3e6 mass, everything else default
matches pretty well

February 2016: Use 2.20e6 mass, everything else default, fits perfectly

December 2020: using 5e5 mass
doesn't seem like there's enough mass here?? to get a consistently high light curve throughout -- ask about this during the meeting...
can't match the last bit again, same issue with not being able to squeeze enough mass out of it at the end


DONE LCs:
